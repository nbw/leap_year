# Leap Year

Leap year calculator.

[Rules for calculating a leap year.](https://www.mathsisfun.com/leap-years.html)

## Code

`lib/year.rb`

I chose to create a **Year* class because you might find a leap year function on a DateTime object or some sort of Date class.

## Testing

I used rspec. After installation, simply run `rspec`

## Install

1. Install bundler.

```
gem install bundler
```

2. Install gems.

```
bundle install
```
